### What I learned

I practiced my CSS Flexbox knowledge by creating this project. I also practiced mobile-first approach technique.

### Continued development

I am still not very comfortable using CSS Flexbox and I hope to improve on it. I also want to learn CSS Grid and Accessibility too.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/) - This site helped me with CSS Flexbox and Mobile-first approach. I really liked it and will mostly use it as my CSS reference in the future. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
